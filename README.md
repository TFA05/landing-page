Website made following the odin project.

This website was odin's way of testing my current knowledge on HTML and CSS and the biggest
challenge whilst making it was the use of flexbox. It was something that I was pretty unfamiliar
with but after using it it's definetly a must use feature in CSS. Overall this website wasn't a big
deal, just a chance to try new CSS things out.
